We can go wherever we want
The plains, the sand, the salt, the dust
You can say whatever you want
I don't care, I'm already gone
We could drive a mile down the road
To get a drink or two, you know
Simple thing, I don't need much to like, I find
And I, and I guess I don't cry
It's a simple thing we're all afraid and shy away
Now I find
I guess I don't shy
I guess I don't shy
I guess that I don't cry
I guess that I don't shy
