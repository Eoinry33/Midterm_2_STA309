If I could wait for a time to be sad about it, sad about it
I'd choose a day when you've gone away
And I'm all alone upstate, all the way upstate
Do you miss my hands hanging on the back of your neck?
It's just somethin' I'm into
Do you miss my name, said it in between your breath
I remember when I see the moon
Add up my love (ooh)
Add up my love
Honey, was it enough? (Ooh)
Is it ever enough?
If I could wait for a time to be mad about it, mad about it
I'd choose a day when you're on your way
And I can say it all to your face, say it to your face
Do you miss my laugh? Hear it from the back of the room
It's just somethin' I miss too
Do you miss all the ways I put you in your place?
You say you like all of my attitude
Add up my love (ooh)
Add up my love
Honey, was it enough? (ooh)
Is it ever enough?
Add up my love (ooh)
Add up my love
Honey, was it enough? (Ooh)
Is it ever enough?
Add up my love (ooh)
Add up my love
Honey, was it enough? (Ooh)
Is it ever enough?
