Sometimes I wonder if you were the one
When you opened the door, cracked me wide open
Something about it doesn't sit right with me
And how could it be?

When I walk away, it always comes in threes
We don't get on, can't make you laugh, personality
But I don't invest the way I'd prefer
Someone to in me

I really hate to admit it
I put my pride on the line
'Cause when I met you, I knew it
I'd thank you for your time
I'd thank you for your time
Thank you for the time

Sometimes I want somebody to see me
How you opened my doors and left them wide open
Why doesn't this happen more naturally?
If I tried, maybe

When you're lonely, you'll just do anything
To drink it all up, the feeling, it's the memory
That's when it all aligns, I can really see
What you meant to me

I really hate to admit it
I put my pride on the line
'Cause when I met you, I knew it
I'd thank you for your time
I'd thank you for your time
Thank you for the time

All because of you
All because of you

I really hate to admit it
I put my pride on the line
'Cause when I met you, I knew it
I'd thank you for your time
I'd thank you for your time
Thank you for the time
