Ooh-ooh, ooh
Come to me slowly
It's when you talk close enough
That I feel it on my skin, breathe it in
Most of these days (most of these days)
I don't get too intimate
Why would I let you in? (Why would I let you in?)
But I think again
I don't even try
I don't have to think
With you, there's no pretending
You know me, you know me
And I just might know you too, know you
Come to me ready
go dancing
(You make me wanna) try on feminine
(You make me wanna) go buy a new dress
(You make me wanna) slip off a new dress
Don't even try
I don't have to think
With you, there's no pretending
You know me, you know me
And I just might know you too, ooh
Come to me slowly
