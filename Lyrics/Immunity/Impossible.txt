How are you feeling? How are you doing?
I'm sorry, I just wanted to hear your voice so clear
What are you thinking? Am I amusing?
It's so strange to talk after all these years
What is the meaning? It's so confusing
All my old feelings coming back to me
When was the last time that I saw your face?
Know it like the back of my hand, I'd say
And you're not that dumb anymore
I picked up the books you threw to the floor
Put them back on the shelf
Don't you see how much I want your help?
And I know we're not the same as we were
Used to be falling hard, now it just hurts me so bad
And you know that I can't hold back
All of these worries that I have had 'bout you
And I know that it's time
To forget how I'm feeling, don't want to give in
But I know, know that it's right
To listen to my breathing and start believing myself
And I know that it's time
To forget how I'm feeling, don't want to give in
But I know, know that it's right
To listen to my breathing and start believing myself
Woah, myself, myself
And I know we're not the same as we were
Used to be falling hard, now it hurts me so bad
And you know that I can't hold back
All of these worries that I have had 'bout you
