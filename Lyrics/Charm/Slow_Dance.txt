Dum, dum, dum, dum
When the moon begins to hide
It's not over
In the window, turnin' light
Does not mean goodbye
And, too, when candles burn out and the record is faded down
I know you've got people to turn to
And too, when candles burn out and the record is faded down
I know you've got people to turn to
What is it that's keeping one foot out
And the other crawling in bed?
And what is it that's keeping you alone
And leaving after we slow dance?
And we fall back in routine
It can't be over
And I remember everything
You used to know her
I could trace it all the way back
I could trace it all the way back
And, too, when candles burn out and the record is faded down (ooh-ooh)
I know you've got people to turn to
And, too, when candles burn out and the record is faded down (ooh-ooh)
I know you've got people to turn to
What is it that's keeping one foot out
And the other crawling in bed?
And what is it that's keeping you alone
And leaving after we slow dance?
And, too, when candles burn out and the record is faded down (ooh-ooh)
I know you've got people to turn to
And, too, when candles burn out and the record is faded down (ooh-ooh)
I know you've got people to turn to
