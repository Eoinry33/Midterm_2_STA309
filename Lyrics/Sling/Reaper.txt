It's nice to hear your voice again
I pushed you so far down and I let you sink through the drain
There's a claw on my shoulder
And she's saying the obvious
"You know eventually you're gonna have to be a provider, too"
She's coming closer, I can feel her breathe
I keep forgetting that I'll have a family
If I listen in, with my hands cupped and on my knees
I can hear the single obnoxious sigh of relief
I'm born to be somebody then somebody comes from me
I'll tell you 'bout the Rabbit Moon and when to keep walking
I'll spare you pain, I can feel my shame come through that door
I can't fuck it up if it's not there at all
I'm born to be somebody then somebody comes from me
I'll show you where I did swim team and drive to Dunwoody
I'll spare you pain, I can feel my shame creep through that floor
I can't fuck it up if it's not there at all
I can't fuck it up if it's not there at all
