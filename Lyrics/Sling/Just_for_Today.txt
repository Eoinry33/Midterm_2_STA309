Honestly, I didn't think I'd end up here this time
Or anywhere at all, I'm distant just enough to never fall behind
Picturing the saddest scene of wearing bedsheets
And two pats on the back, it just takes time
It's getting late, since when did taking time take all my life?
Mommy
I'm afraid I've been talking to the hotline again
It's stirring, but the ripples always seek out the ones who carry me
I blocked out the month of February for support
At least I have this year, I won't be worrying anyone on tour
As we speak, I'm here to meet devils for tea
Peering round the corner of my life
I throw my drink into the faces of my demise, mm
At 30
Your honey's gonna ask you, "What the hell is wrong with me?"
And finally
An answer from your throat comes crawling
And you can proceed
