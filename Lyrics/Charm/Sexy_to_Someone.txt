Sexy to someone is all I really want
Sometimes sexy to someone is all I really want
Nothin' more, nothin' less of thought, walkin' through the park
Sexy to someone, I think about it all
Checkin' out of the hotel or moments at a bar
Ask if I'm in a movie, no, I didn't get the part
Sexy to somebody, it would help me out
Oh, I need a reason to get out of the house
And it's just a little thing I can't live without
Sexy is somethin' I see in everything
Honey stickin' to your hands, sugar on the rim
Nothin' more, nothin' less of thought, take it all to heart
I want afterglowin' and when I call a car
Send me eyes with the knowin' that I could pull it off
Ask if I'm doin' TV, no, I didn't get the job
Sexy to somebody, it would help me out
Oh, I need a reason to get out of the house
And it's just a little thing I can't live without
I want to be sexy to someone (is it too much to ask?)
I want to be sexy to someone (then what's holdin' you back?)
I want to be sexy to someone (it's not too much to ask)
Sexy to someone
Sexy to somebody, it would help me out
Oh, I need a reason to get out of the house
And it's just a little thing I can't live without
Sexy to somebody, it would help me out
Oh, I need a reason to get out of the house
And it's just a little thing I can't live without
