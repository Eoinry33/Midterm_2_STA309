I can feel there's something in the between
For a moment, I heard you talking to me
When I drive, I always check over the seat
I could see you right there, waiting on me
I pull on the string that binds me to memories of
The way I loved you
I push on the door
The one I've ignored
The one that leads me to you
Glory of the snow
I'm waking up and now I know
Mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm
Mhm, mhm, mhm
Mhm, mhm, mhm
Mhm-mhm, mhm
I can see there's someone looking for me
For a moment, I heard the rustle in leaves
When I cry, I wanna give you a ring
I can breathe with you right there
Hold onto me
I dust the windows, the shutters, the channels
Where you'd sit, paper and pen
Sweeping under rugs
The one I was not gonna
Gonna dance on again
Glory of the snow
I'm waking up and now I know
Mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm
Mhm, mhm, mhm
Mhm, mhm, mhm
Mhm-mhm, mhm
