I'm nervous, couldn't tell you why
Touching me, hands warm on my thighs
And I know I could turn a blind eye
Afraid of what I'm gonna find
Does it really have to be this way?
Oh, when my body hasn't felt the same?
Since you left my apartment
Think my pillows still have your scent
I just want to let you know
I'm seeing sides that you don't show
And I know that we got some potential
'Cause that love you gave me was so gentle
Do you think that you could stay?
I need more time, I need to get away from you
Pour my love out
Spinning all on the ground
Is it all I have? What are you saying?
Usually I'd be fine, but my head is spinning
I never let anybody in
Somehow you got under my skin
Never seen a face like yours
I got it together but my breath feels short
I don't wanna close the door
Maybe I should just go up north
All I'm tryna say
Is I miss you in every way
Fingertips on my back
Things I know that I can't have
Never seen a face like yours
I got it together but my breath feels short
I don't wanna close the door
Maybe I should just go up north
