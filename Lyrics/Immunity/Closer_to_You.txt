I feel it in my bones
Even when I'm alone
Mama said, "I told you so"
Going down a different road
You call me late at night
I pick up every time
Wish that I could rewind
Get some peace of mind
Shut up
Don't wanna hear it, now, I'm fed up
Wish I could say it was enough (oh)
To make me walk away
And I'm messed up
'Cause every time I start to get up
And now my head feels fucked up
And I know it won't change
The things you do
Only make me want to get closer to you
And the things that you say
Only make me want to stay
Can't push me away
I'm not going, I'll wait
You know this street runs two ways, say
So I need to hear your voice
Know I'm standing here by choice
And I can't hear the background noise, anyway
Shut up
Don't wanna hear it, now, I'm fed up
Wish I could say it was enough (oh)
To make me walk away
And I'm messed up
'Cause every time I start to get up
And now my head feels fucked up
And I know it won't change
The things you do
Only make me want to get closer to you
And the things that you say
Only make me want to stay
