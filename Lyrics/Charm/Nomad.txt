I'd run the risk of losing everything
Sell all my things, become nomadic
I'd run the risk, and just in case, I might
Sell all my things and become the night
Oh, it's hard to believe
It's even irrational for me
I'm cynical, a mess
I'm touch starved and shameless
Mm-hmm
But I'd rather be alone than a stranger
You'd come visit me late at night
I'd rather wake up alone than be reminded
Of how it was a dream this time
I'd run the risk of losing everyone
I'd sail and say my phone was overboard
I'd run the risk, and just in case, I might
Take a ship around the world to find
Oh, where you hid the key?
It's even irrational for me
It's chemical, obsessed
I blame you for locking me in
Mm-hmm, ah
But I'd rather be alone than a stranger
You'd come visit me late at night
I'd rather wake up alone than be reminded
Of how it was a dream this time
It's always the same
Always the same
Every time I see someone new
I just think of you, nothing I do
Can help it now
Guess I'll have to find
That I'd rather be alone than a stranger
You'd come visit me late at night
I'd rather wake up alone than be reminded
Of how it was a dream this time
It was a dream this time
It was a dream this time
