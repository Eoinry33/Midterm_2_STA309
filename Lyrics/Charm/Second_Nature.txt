Da-dum, da-da-da-da-da-dum, da-da-da-da-dum-dum-dum
Da-dum, da-da-da-da-da-dum, da-da-da-da-da-dum-dum
It's when you're close enough to touch
I've forgotten the point
My train of thought destroyed
It's when you're loud enough to cut
And in through all the noise
My train of thought destroyed
And once you get in my ear
I see kismet sinking in
It's second nature
Like the sap from a cedar
Rolling down to be near her
It's second nature
It's when you're close enough to love
I move without a void
My train of thought destroyed
And when I tell you, it's because
I've known you well before
My train of thought destroyed
And once you get in my ear
I see kismet sinking in
It's second nature
Like the sap from a cedar
Rolling down to be near her
It's second nature
Soon you'll realize too
How it, it aligns you
Ought to know, know the
Know the truth
Da-dum, da-da-da-da-da-dum, da-da-da-da-dum-dum-dum
Da-dum, da-da-da-da-da-dum, da-da-da-da-da-dum-dum
And once you get in my ear
I see kismet sinking in
It's second nature
Like the sap from a cedar
Rolling down to be near her
It's second nature
