Is it alright
To feel this way so early?
And in my blood
All the sweet nothings fallin' in love overnight
Didn't mean to get so close
And I know that I should probably go
But I got this feeling
Tell me, girl, I gotta know
Touch you softly
I call you up late at night
Know that it isn't right
But you could be my one and only
You get me in the mood
Know what I'm tryna do
Do you think that we can move
Closer, baby? I want you
Yeah, yeah
And all my life
Been wanting this forever, oh
And in my mind
Think of ways to ask you, "Why don't you come over sometime?"
Didn't mean to get so close
And I know that I should probably go
But I got this feeling
Tell me, girl, I gotta know
Touch you softly
I call you up late at night
Know that it isn't right
But you could be my one and only
You get me in the mood
Know what I'm tryna do
Do you think that we can move
Closer, baby? I want you
Yeah, yeah
And I don't care what they say
And I don't care what they say
Care what they say to me
I'm doing it differently
Baby
I'm doing it differently
