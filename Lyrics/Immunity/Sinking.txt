Every night
Think of things I can't do or haven't done
And does it make me weak?
Sometimes I feel like I can't breathe
Is it all you see in me?
Don't you wait for something more
I'll still be sinking to the floor
Oh, you can't help me
Now I'm all alone
Is it my doing? Is it my doing?
Outside is getting colder
Why does it feel like I'm older than I asked to be?
But when you say my name
It all falls away so tenderly
Don't you wait for something more
I'll still be sinking to the floor
Oh, you tried to help me
Why do I feel so cold?
Is it my doing? Is it my doing?
Is it my doing? Is it my doing?
Is it my doing? Oh
Hmm, is it my doing? Hmm
