And if you need to disappear
You'll have no reason to be sad at all
You'll strike your own matches to logs
May catch an eye while you play sad and soft
And if you're walking home alone
You'll find a reason, you'll just chalk it up
To being different, being young
And wonder why no one knew you at all
Oh
You're just playin' dumb
What's the cost of it, of being loved
When close is not close enough?
Where's your line, when do you draw
When close is not close enough?
Mm, mm
Ooh, ooh, ooh
And when you find you're at the pier
Playing out moments when there was a touch
With strangers touching everywhere
You wonder if he knows she's gonna run
Oh
It's somethin' you've done
Opened my hands and I know I've shed some
When close is not close enough (ooh, ooh, ooh)
Where's the fun in it? And now I'm too tough
From close being just too much
Mm, mm
Ooh, ooh, ooh (ah, ah, ah)
