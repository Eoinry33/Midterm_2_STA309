Holding out all my fears and faults
Those that conquer me
Started the second pack
'Fore the first one's finishing
I like to bridge the gap between
A break and long-lost lovers
Only to get me, by until I decide
I've had enough
Most of the time, I can feel them on me
The eyes from the stranger's window
It's dark, and it's lonely, but it's nothin' to me
At least somebody's home
Decades are wasting on your name
You'll grasp the concept of life
When you give up the point of trying
If you don't do the things that you do
They'll just happen to you
Pulling out all my weight
And do my part and you'll say
Oh, I'm so glad you're here with us today
You probably thought you would be gone
And until there's another way
I just have to face that there's no real place
To go and I could really be alone
I'd promise you now that if I had known
I wouldn't be standing here
There's memories to be made
And water that's to wade
I used it all up, drying tears
Of course, I don't regret
The moments where I wept
And yearned for what I've got now
It's only time, it won't age like wine
But it's mine and I'll take the blow
