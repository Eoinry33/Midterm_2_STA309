See me standing on the corner of Comstock and Waverly in a daze
Where I saw my brother speak for the first time since he graduated in the spring
Got a cold piece of information to bring to you
Said, "Sorry, but I can't stay here while we wait for June"
I miss the southern Cosmos and the Zinnias, oh, the Zinnias
It comes to me in a dream, in the dead heat and the suffocating wet grip
That's got a hold on my mama, it's Marietta's kiss
Quietly, I'm tempted
Sure sounds nice to settle down for a whilе
Let the real еstate show itself to me
I could wake up with a baby in a sling
Just a couple doors down from Abigail
My sister, man and her ring
