Traveled so far on my own
I don't know where I have gone
And I don't wanna be alone
When I am so far from my home
You wanna feel something
But I don't feel nothing
Trying so hard to get over you
Wanna go back to the place where we started
At the party, I see you, but you keep your guard up
We could be something special if you wanted
I'm afraid that if we try to
You would just give up
(You would just give up)
You wanna feel something
But I don't feel nothing
Trying so hard to get over you
You wanna feel something
But I don't feel nothing
Trying so hard to get over you
You wanna feel something
But I don't feel nothing
Trying so hard to get over you
You wanna feel something
But I don't feel nothing
Trying so hard to get over you
