There is something that I need from you
And you're the only one that knows
And if I told the world I needed you
Would you hear your name echo? (Echo)
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh
Our love is meant to be shared
While our love goes nowhere
There's a secret I can't keep from you
And I think you already know
It's in the things I see in you
And what you notice I echo (echo)
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh
Our love is meant to be shared
While our love goes nowhere
Our love is meant to be shared
While our love goes nowhere
